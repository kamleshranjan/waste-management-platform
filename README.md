We all know India is facing  the problem of waste management and disposal. Almost more than 70% of waste produced are left to rot and pollute the environment .  So our service provides a link between large and small scale waste producers like private firms and industries and potential waste collectors. So we provide the facility for the both producers and collectors to search for corresponding potential producers and collectors. For eg…….. we also provide the facility to report about any waste related problem such as garbage dumps in the city which is left aside . so in this way we are contributing towards environment sector…….health sector…….employment sector……..economic sector……..political sector…….
